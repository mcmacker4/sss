[Original project](https://github.com/pagoru/sss) by [@pagoru](https://github.com/pagoru)

This is a port to the front-end in order to avoid possible man-in-the-middle attacks.
Original version sends `secret` and `service` to the server and the server calculates the password.

In this version passwords are calculated in the client's side with no communication with the server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
